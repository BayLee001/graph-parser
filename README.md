## Ungrounded Semantic Parser

GraphParser can parse natural language sentences to logical parses and graphs. Run the following command

> cat input.txt | sh run.sh

## Online demo
Online demo of GraphParser can be accessed at http://54.148.203.81/graph-parser-app/UngroundedSemanticParserServlet

## Evaluation datasets
If you are interested in evaluation datasets, and the output of GraphParser on the test datasets, you can download them using

> ./install.py evaluation

The datasets will be downloaded to the folders data/tacl_splits and data/tacl_ouput. 

## Grounded Semantic Parser
To replicate TACL results, you will have to install Freebase SPARQL endpoint. Please email me personally.
