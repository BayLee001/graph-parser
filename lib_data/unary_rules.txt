# Format:

# OldCategory	NewCategory	OptionalLambdaTransformation

# You just have to specify the common variables in the old and new category.
# Lambda transformation describe the way semantics change from old to new

# If lambda transformation is not specified, we perform a default transformation using the connecting variables.
# 		First a semantic category for new category is generated using CLOSED construction.  
# 		Relation tuples from the old semantic category are appended to the new semantic category.
